Next versions :
i want to add functions for making Dump files for Infected process and making text report files
and i want to add Network Monitor for this tool with API ;)
i have idea about make service for this tool with IPS Mode [on] in future.



Note: sometimes this application detect itself like a backdoor , because in Source code this application try to scanning itself too 
you can fix that in C# Source Code for avoid itself scanning . (not recommended)
because this application detecting meterpreter signature bytes in itself memory too. (don't worry its ok) ;-)


Test:
I tested this tool by my own Encrypted Backdoor "C#" and Metasploit and Powershell Backdoors by SET tool.
Armitage not tested , i think you can detect Armitage backdoors with this tool.
Cobaltstrike not tested .
Empire not detected Unfortunately ;) maybe fortunately , because emipre native payloads was different with signature in this tool.
